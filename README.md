###### Employee Template

This application allows employers to quickly create a list of their employee's by simply entering information into node prompts provided by inquirer. The user has the option to choose from three employee types: manager, engineer, intern. Each different employee type then has a unique class defined in node that gives them a unique representation on the html page that is rendered after the user finishes entering their information.
